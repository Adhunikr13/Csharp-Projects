                        Problem Statement
                        Design and implement a Windows Forms Application using Visual Studio 2017, C# and
                        SQL Server 2017.The application allows the user to manage the employee information for a
                        given company.
                        Following is the list of the application’s operations
                        1. Save: Save new employee information to the database EmployeeDB.mdf.
                        Note: For simplicity (in this lab), each employee information should include the
                        following:
                         Employee number
                         First name
                         Last name
                         Job title (e.g. MIS Manager/Sales Manager)
                        2. Search: Search an employee information by
                         an employee number
                         a first name /last name
                        3. Update: Update employee information. Confirmation message is required.
                        4. Delete: Delete employee information. Confirmation message is required.
                        5. List All : List all the employees in a ListView control
                        6. Exit: Exit the application. An elegant confirmation message should be displayed.
                            Data Validation
                            1. The employee number must be a 4-digit number and unique.
                            2. The first name / last name / job title contains only letters. A whitespace
                            can be used only to separate the name component if required.
